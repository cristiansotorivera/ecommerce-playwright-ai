A **modern, AI-augmented test automation framework** designed for scalable ecommerce testing.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

Most automation frameworks:

* ❌ focus only on test execution
* ❌ ignore maintainability
* ❌ don’t leverage AI effectively

This framework solves that by combining:

* 🎭 **Playwright** → reliable browser automation
* 🧠 **GitHub Copilot** → AI-assisted development
* 🤖 **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** → AI agents that can run and analyze tests
* ⚡ **GitHub Actions** → CI/CD automation

👉 Result: a **future-ready QA framework**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Scalable **TypeScript Playwright framework**
* Page Object Model + Fixtures
* Environment-based configuration (dev / qa / stage)
* Test tagging strategy (@smoke, @cart, @checkout)
* Authentication reuse (storage state)
* CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
* AI-ready architecture (Copilot + MCP)
* Custom MCP server for:

  * running tests
  * reading test data
  * analyzing results

## ⚙️ Setup

Install dependencies:

npm install

Install browsers:

npx playwright install

Create `.env` file:

BASE_URL=https://www.saucedemo.com
API_BASE_URL=https://www.saucedemo.com
TEST_USER_EMAIL=standard_user
TEST_USER_PASSWORD=secret_sauce

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

npm test
npm run test:ui
npm run test:smoke
npm run test:cart
npm run test:checkout
npm run test:headed
npm run test:debug
npm run report

---

## 🔐 Authentication Strategy

* Login runs once in setup project
* Session is reused across all tests
* Improves performance and stability

---

## 🏷️ Test Strategy

@smoke → critical user flows
@cart → cart functionality
@checkout → checkout scenarios
@account → user flows
@regression → full coverage

---

## 🤖 AI + MCP Integration

### Playwright MCP

* UI inspection
* Locator discovery
* Browser automation

### Custom Ecommerce MCP

Tools available:

* run_smoke_tests
* run_cart_tests
* run_tests_by_tag
* list_test_products
* list_test_users
* get_latest_test_results

👉 Enables **AI-driven testing workflows**:

* generate tests
* run tests
* analyze failures

---

## 🧠 GitHub Copilot Integration

This project includes:

* Custom instructions
* Prompt templates
* Structured workflows
